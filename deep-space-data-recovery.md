### **The 2025 Consumer Choice Award Winner | Located at the Regus Ballard Center**

When the **Modular UDSLA (Universal Deep-Space Lens Attachment)** captures a photon that has traveled millions of light-years, that data is priceless. Developed by **Revolutionary Technology**, this device uses a **Hybrid Optical Path**—fusing a **120mm Primary Collector** with a **Microscope Objective Magnifier**—to image the cosmos.

Recovering this data requires more than IT support; it requires physics-based reconstruction. At our **Seattle Ballard** laboratory, we serve the Pacific Northwest’s aerospace sector, using proprietary **Super Processing** to rescue critical telemetry and imaging data from the **UDSLA prototypes**.

### **The Challenge: Recovering "Pressurized" Data**

The UDSLA is an engineering marvel encased in a **Titanium/Kevlar chassis** and pressurized to **1.5–2.0 Atmospheres (22–30 psi)** to mimic the stiffness of Navy scopes. This unique environment creates complex data dependencies:

* **The Imaging:** High-resolution **Canon EOS R5 Mark II** sensors capture the "aerial image" formed inside the optical tube.

* **The Control:** A **Samsung Galaxy S25** acts as the flight computer, logging pressure regulation and focus motor telemetry via USB-C.

If a seal fails or radiation corrupts the storage, standard recovery tools cannot correlate the **pressure logs** with the **image timestamps**, rendering the scientific data useless.

### **"Super Processing" at the Ballard Lab**

We use the same industrial hardware stack in Seattle as we do in Hollywood to reconstruct these "Hybrid" datasets.

#### **1\. Decoupling the Hybrid Optical Path (Dual Intel XEON)**

* **The Math:** The UDSLA feeds a telescope image into a microscope objective. This creates unique optical metadata.

* **The Recovery:** We use **Dual Multi-Core Intel XEON Servers** to parse the **Canon CR3 RAW** files. Our algorithms separate the **microscopic magnification artifacts** from digital corruption, ensuring that the star clusters you see are real, not pixel noise.

#### **2\. Samsung Galaxy S25 Telemetry (1TB ECC RAM)**

* **The Math:** The **Samsung Galaxy S25** manages the nitrogen gap pressure. Loss of this log data invalidates the optical test.

* **The Recovery:** We use **1TB of ECC (Error-Correcting Code) RAM** to buffer the **Android System Logs** and **USB Telemetry streams**. We recover the precise millisecond records of the **focus motors**, proving that the lens was stable at the moment of capture.

#### **3\. Visual Verification (NVIDIA RTX 50 TUF)**

* **The Quality Control:** To verify the **120mm Primary Lens** performance, we use the **NVIDIA GeForce RTX 50 TUF Series**.

* **The Render:** We real-time render the massive **45MP RAW files**, checking for "pressure distortion" or "fogging" in the image center—confirming the integrity of the **Titanium housing** and the data itself.
