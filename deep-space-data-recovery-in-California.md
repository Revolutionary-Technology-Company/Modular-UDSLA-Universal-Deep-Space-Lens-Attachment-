### **The 2025 Consumer Choice Award Winner | "Super Processing" for Deep-Space Data at 1800 North Vine St.**

When the **Modular UDSLA (Universal Deep-Space Lens Attachment)** captures a high-resolution image of a distant nebula, it isn't just taking a picture—it is gathering light through a complex **Hybrid Optical Path** involving a **120mm Primary Collector** and a **Microscope Objective Magnifier**1.

These files are massive, complex, and irreplaceable. Whether due to **radiation damage** on the storage media or a **pressurization failure** within the **Titanium/Kevlar chassis**2, a **lost or corrupted** UDSLA dataset represents a loss of scientific discovery.

**Seattle Data Recovery** is the trusted partner for recovering these critical assets. From our secure facility at the **Hollywood Entertainment & Production Center (1800 North Vine Street)** 3, we use proprietary **Super Processing** to reconstruct the high-fidelity data captured by the UDSLA's **NASA-supplied camera systems**4.

### **The UDSLA Challenge: Recovering "Hybrid" Optical Data**

The **UDSLA** is not a standard telescope. It operates under a specific **internal pressure target of 1.5 to 2.0 Atmospheres** to dampen vibration5. The data it produces is a unique fusion of telescopic and microscopic imaging, captured on high-resolution sensors like the **Canon EOS R5 Mark II**6.

 

Standard recovery tools cannot distinguish between the **aerial image** data formed by the collector and the random noise of a corrupted drive7. We can.

#### **1\. Reconstructing Canon R5 Mark II RAW Streams**

* **The Data:** The UDSLA utilizes the **Canon EOS R5 Mark II** to capture **45MP** high-resolution images8.

* **The Recovery:** We use **Dual Intel XEON Servers** to parse the complex **CR3 RAW** headers. Our "Super Processing" algorithms differentiate between the **Microscope Objective** magnification artifacts and digital corruption, ensuring the scientific validity of the image9.

#### **2\. Samsung Galaxy S25 Telemetry Recovery**

* **The Data:** The **Samsung Galaxy S25 (12GB RAM)** acts as the flight computer, managing pressure regulation via **USB-C**10.

* **The Recovery:** We recover the **Android log files** and **pressure sensor telemetry** stored on the device. This allows engineers to correlate image timestamps with internal pressure readings (PSI) to verify optical stability11.

#### **3\. "Super Processing" with NVIDIA RTX 50 TUF**

* **The Visualization:** To verify the recovery of the **Hybrid Optical Path**, we use the **NVIDIA GeForce RTX 50 TUF Series**.

* **The QC:** We render the RAW data in real-time, checking for "fogging" artifacts that might indicate a failure in the **optical coupling gel** or **dry air-spaced connection**12.

### **Hollywood, CA: The Hub for Aerospace Data Recovery**

Much of this specialized work is performed at our **Hollywood location**, strategically situated to serve the aerospace and tech sectors intersecting with the entertainment industry.

Hollywood Entertainment & Production Center

**1800 North Vine Street, Los Angeles, CA 90028** 13

* **Secure Facility:** Located near **Sunset Boulevard** and the **Capitol Records Building**, our lab offers the physical security required for **NASA** and **Revolutionary Technology** assets14.

* **Producer L.A.G.'s Quality Control:** Founded by **L.A.G.**, a veteran Los Angeles Producer, we apply "Studio Grade" quality control to scientific data. We ensure that every recovered **TIFF**, **CR3**, or **Android Log** is bit-perfect before it leaves our **Class 100 Clean Room**.
